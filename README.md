# Specification Document: Autosar Crypto

This repository is part of a PoC demonstrator in order to conduct a feasibility study whether to utilize a git/flow based specification development methodology for the telematics infrastructure specification (TI) of the German federal health system.

The PoC utilises [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) for describing the required specifications and the [sphinx-needs](https://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) extension module to be able to manage requirements which is essential for specifying a robust system, targeted to process delicate personal data of about 80 million German citizens.

The specification contained in this repository covers the description of the "Autosar Crypto", which itself is not a component of the TI. However, due to the complexitity and maturity of the [Autosar Crypto Specification](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/adaptive/22-11/AUTOSAR_RS_Cryptography.pdf), it is intended to serve as a good sample for the TI PoC in order to get an impression of the full potential of the proposed solution.
